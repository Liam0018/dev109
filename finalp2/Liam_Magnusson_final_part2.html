<ul>
  <li> What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript? </li>
<p>
  Virtually nonexistent, of course I had minor contact with it almost every day as many things online come into contact with html in one way or another but I didn't even know what html stood for, this goes the same for Javascript as all I knew about it was the name, and I didn't even know CSS existed.
  </p>
  <li> Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why? </li>
  <p>
  I went with the template for my portfolio. This was because at the time of starting my work on it I believed I did not have enough time and wanted every advantage I could take. I was not confident enough in my ability to use CSS and html at this time and the template really helped to get a head start. Examining the layout also helped my understand CSS a little better.
  </p>
    <li> What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)? </li>
  <p>
  I think the most challenging part of the template was just how tedious it got towards the end when all I had left to do was verify the html of every page, necessary I understand but still tedious.
  </p>
    <li> How did this class change your view on Web Development? </li>
 <p>
  This class definitely gave me a new perspective on what exactly html is along with CSS and javascript. It also gave me a newfound respect for what web developers actually do and the problems they have to navigate.
  </p>
   <li> What would you recommend to future students taking this class? </li>
 <p>
  I'd tell them to utilize the resources! Not only that I'd tell them to not be afraid of going out and looking for their own resources. The internet is vast and a lot of the school provided texts might not be able to explain things as well as some random guy on the internet.
